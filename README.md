# Appalachain-Trail

A website I created over quarantine to help my gym teacher track student activity. Students would create a account to log their steps and be able to see their steps out of the class total. On the home page students can see how thier class compares to other classes and how far their class has goneon the Appalachain trail using average length of a persons gait.
